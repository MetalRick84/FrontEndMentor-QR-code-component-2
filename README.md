### What I learned

How to make a Site "Fullscreen" (fills up the whole viewport) for mobile browsers by using the svh-unit. I got the Idea from a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=veEqYQlfNx8&list=PLOpMjItTc9kUXHgr1i0ifbByr3yV_DxTt&index=3) from Kevin Powell

### Useful resources

- [Codeademy](https://www.codecademy.com) - I currently do the Career-Path "Front-End Engineer"
- [Kevin Powell - The problem with viewport units](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=veEqYQlfNx8&list=PLOpMjItTc9kUXHgr1i0ifbByr3yV_DxTt&index=3) - This helped me make the site "full-viewport" and show the FrontEnd-Mentor div always at the bottom.
